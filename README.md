# thedailypositive
A webex teams bot which can create positive messages, daily. 

This is a very early version so it is pretty basic. Right now it
1) uses quotes.txt to store quotes, 
2) uses greetings.txt to store greetings
3) uses environment variable for Token
4) Gets list of current rooms. Generates a random greeting and quote. Posts this into the rooms for which this bot is subscribed.
